## Section 1 Reflection

1. How did the SuperLearner Article resonate with you? What from this list do you already do? Want to start doing or do more of? Is there anything not on this list, that you would add to it?

 This article has some good reminders â€“ maybe some seems like common sense, but the kind of common sense we forget to use every day. One of my New Year's resolutions is to read more. I'm on book number 3 for the year so far, but we'll see. I guess some coursework may have to count this year, but I'll be excited for fun books on break weeks. I think the first 4 things are already part of my overall mindset; they seem like things I already think about to different extents. The last two are hard in their own way (sleeping enough, taking breaks, etc.), but I think during Turing they will be critical to success. I need to work on those routines.

 One thing I'd add to this list? Failing! A lot! And then learning from that for the next go-around.

2. How would you print the string `"Hello World!"` to the terminal?

  `p "Hello World"`

3. What character is used to indicate comments in a ruby file?

  `#`

4. Explain the difference between an integer and a float?

  A float or floating point number has a decimal. Integers are only whole numbers.

5. In the space below, create a variable `animal` that holds the string   `"zebra"`

  `animal = "zebra"`

6. How would you print the string `"zebra"` using the variable that you created above?

  `p animal`

7. What is interpolation? Use interpolation to print a sentence using the variable `animal`.

  Interpolation is the interpretation and implementation of code within a string, for example, being able to add a variable into that string that will allow the variable's value to appear in that string.

  ```rb
  "My pet #{animal} is named 'Susan'"
  ```

8. What method is used to get input from a user?

  `gets.chomp`

9. Name and describe two common string methods:

  `.length` gives you the number of characters (including spaces) in a given string.
  `.gsub` allows you to replace all instances of a given string with another string.
